1. You should not create color palettes for your app when building a startup project. You shouldn't define colors. Because designers will end up picking whatever color they want, you won't be able to keep up. Just copy the color from figma directly into the code. Don't try to find a solution for colors. Thinking it might be better in the long run. It won't. You should only create color palettes and themes when the project is release to public.
